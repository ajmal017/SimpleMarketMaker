# market maker-fee chaser
deribit mm-replication (a modified version of https://github.com/deribit/deribit-api-python)

Only for hobby: a copy paste project made by a non-programmer. Please do not use the code for actual trading

to do:
- additional ability to:
  a) respond to strong market movement (both of qty and price)
  b) change bid/ask based on certain parameters (equity, maintenance margin, etc)
  c) perform multi accounts task

- refresh/tidy up/improve efficiency bot code
